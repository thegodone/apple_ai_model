# AI Apple Model AttentiveFP original (Dense version)

You need a M1/M2/M3/... mac!

You need to install MLX, pytorch and rdkit, just create a conda env and install MLX, pytorch and rdkit using via pip or conda.

This is an example of usage of MLX implementation of AttentiveFP original code (code is not exactly similar to the paper "equations"!).

The goal is also to have a benchmark of the MLX, Pytorch Jax and Tensorflow implementation on GPU (Apple Metal) using exactly the same model.

To do:
- [x] Add Pytorch version
- [ ] Add Jax version
- [ ] Add Tensorflow version
