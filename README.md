# AI Apple Model AttentiveFP original (Dense version)

you need a M1/M2/M3/... mac!
you need to install MLX and rkdit, just create a conda env and install MLX and rdkit using via pip or conda.

This is an example of usage of MLX implementation of AttentiveFP original code (code is not exactly similar to the paper "equations"!).

THe goal is also to have a benchmark of the MLX, Pytorch Jax and Tensorflow implementation on GPU (Apple Metal)

To do:
[] Add Pytorch version
[] Add Jax version
[] Add Tensorflow version
